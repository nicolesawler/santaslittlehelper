Hi!

Welcome to Santa's Little Helper.

This will prepare you to build a beautiful website by giving you the primary fundamental files to do so.

This toy consists of only the basic HTML,CSS and JS files. Any server-side code will have to be created separately.

Get going and get creative!


If you like my stuff, head to www.nicolesawler.com for more!

Thanks,

Happy Coding!
